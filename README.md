# mulmoterminal

**Run a whole team of coding agents from your browser — and actually keep up with them.**

MulmoTerminal turns [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (and OpenAI's **Codex**)
into a parallel, observable workspace: many agent sessions at once in a grid, each one
color-coded so you see at a glance which are **working**, which **need you**, and which are
**done** — plus rich GUI output, git worktrees with one-click PRs, cost readouts, and a
ping to your phone when a task finishes. One `npx` command, no Electron, no config.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal        # starts on http://localhost:34567 and opens your browser
```

## Why you'll want it

- **See every agent at once.** A grid of live sessions, each cell color-coded by state —
  **working** (blue), **blocked / needs a permission** (amber), **done, unreviewed** (blue),
  **idle** — with an attention chime and a toolbar tally, so an off-screen agent that's stuck
  never slips past you. Stop babysitting one terminal; supervise ten.
- **A GUI for your agents, not just a terminal.** Beside the terminal, a **Canvas** panel
  renders what an agent produces over MCP — **documents, forms, charts, generated images,
  HTML, collection cards** — each drawn by its own plugin. The agent doesn't just print
  text; it hands you an interface.
- **Get pulled back from anywhere.** A finished background task sends a **Web Push to your
  phone**, and the **RemoteHost** companion lets you watch and start sessions from the phone
  itself — walk away, get pinged, jump back in.
- **Nothing is lost on a restart.** With `tmux`, every session survives a server crash,
  restart, or `node --watch` reload — a mid-turn agent, a long build, a dev server all keep
  running and reattach when you come back.
- **Ship without leaving the grid.** Each repo cell shows a **git branch chip**, isolates
  work in a one-click **git worktree**, opens a **diff** panel, and does **commit / push /
  open PR** — so several agents can work the same repo without colliding.
- **Know what it's costing.** Per-session **context %**, **token**, and **estimated $**
  readouts, an **activity timeline** of tool calls, and **AI-summarized** cell titles and
  command-output explanations — so a wall of parallel agents stays legible.
- **Make it yours.** Per-directory **themes, colors, and name badges** (`prod` in red,
  `staging` in amber), a configurable header (buttons + info chips), custom attention sounds,
  and Run / Skill menus to launch a project's scripts and `.claude/skills` right inside a cell.

### What it is, under the hood

Each session runs as a real PTY on the server (the agent CLI in a pseudo-terminal) and is
streamed to an [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) terminal in the browser over a WebSocket. A
sidebar lists every session for the project and reflects, in real time, which are **working**
(the agent is thinking) and which **need attention** (waiting for input, or finished with
output you haven't seen) — driven by Claude/Codex activity hooks the server injects per spawn.

**Inserting a file path** — like a native terminal, you can put a file's absolute path into
the prompt: **drag a file** onto the terminal (works where the browser exposes the path via
`file://` — Firefox/Safari), or click the **📎 file button** in the terminal header, which
asks the local server to open the OS file dialog and inserts the chosen path (works in every
browser, including Chrome). The path is inserted at the cursor — it is not submitted, so you
can review it first.

## Install & run

Requires the [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI on your `PATH` and
**Node ≥ 22.9**. Optional but recommended: **`tmux`** so terminals survive a server
restart (see [Session persistence (tmux)](#session-persistence-tmux)), the **`gh`** CLI
logged in for the PRs/Issues view and one-click PR creation, and — for Codex sessions —
the **`codex`** CLI on your `PATH`.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal           # start on http://localhost:34567 and open the browser
# or install globally:
npm install -g mulmoterminal
mulmoterminal
```

A global install isn't auto-updated, so on startup MulmoTerminal checks npm and
prints a one-line notice when a newer version is available (`npm i -g mulmoterminal`
to update). Disable with `MULMOTERMINAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` (or `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`).

Options: `--cwd <dir>` (working directory — relative paths allowed; defaults to the
directory you run the command from), `--port <n>` (default 34567), `--no-open`,
`--version`, `--help`.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal --cwd ./my-project   # work in a specific directory
```

The published package ships the server (run via `tsx`) plus the pre-built web UI;
`npx mulmoterminal` checks for the `claude` CLI, picks a free port, starts the
server, and opens the browser. For local development from a clone, see
[Running](#running).

```

- **Terminal I/O** flows over a raw WebSocket (`/ws`), one PTY per session.
- **Session list** is fetched over HTTP (`/api/sessions`).
- **Live activity** is pushed over a Socket.IO pub/sub channel (`/ws/pubsub`);
  the server learns of activity from **Claude hooks** that POST to `/api/hook`.
- **Other terminals** run on their own raw WebSockets: **Codex** sessions on `/ws/codex`,
  persistent **launch commands** on `/ws/launch`, and one-off **script commands**
  (`yarn dev`, tests, …) on `/ws/run`. Only Claude/Codex are agent sessions with hooks;
  see [Agents: Claude & Codex](#agents-claude--codex) and [Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu).
- In dev (`yarn dev`) the Vite dev server runs on its own port (`CLIENT_PORT`,
  default `6856`) and proxies `/ws` (a prefix covering `/ws/codex`, `/ws/launch`, and
  `/ws/run`), `/ws/pubsub`, `/api`, and `/artifacts` to the backend (`PORT`, default
  `34567`) — so you open the Vite port (e.g. `http://localhost:6856`). In production the
  backend serves the built client from `dist/` on `PORT`, and you open that.

---

## Why a PTY?

Claude Code's interactive mode renders its UI with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)
(a React-based TUI framework), which requires a real **TTY** to be attached. A
plain `child_process.spawn()` provides no TTY, so interactive Claude won't start
(it stays silent). [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) allocates a
real **pseudo-terminal** at the OS level, so from Claude's point of view it's
running in an ordinary terminal — full TUI rendering, cursor movement, colors,
and tool-approval prompts all work. We don't use `-p`/headless mode or the Agent
SDK; we drive the real interactive CLI and relay its TTY over the WebSocket.

> **macOS note:** node-pty's bundled `spawn-helper` binary ships without the
> execute bit (mode 644), which causes a `posix_spawnp failed` error. The
> `postinstall` script (`server/fix-pty-perms.js`) fixes it to 755 automatically.

---

## Agents: Claude & Codex

MulmoTerminal drives **interactive coding-agent CLIs**, not just Claude. An
`AgentAdapter` seam abstracts the per-agent bits (which binary to spawn, how it resumes)
so the PTY, grid, persistence, and GUI-panel plumbing stay shared. Two adapters ship
today — **Claude Code** (the default) and **Codex**.

- **Claude** — spawned as `claude` (override with `CLAUDE_BIN`). The server passes
  `--session-id <uuid>`, so it knows the live session's id even before its transcript
  file exists, and injects activity hooks + the GUI MCP per spawn (see
  [Claude hook injection](#claude-hook-injection)).
- **Codex** — spawned as `codex` (override with `CODEX_BIN`; `CODEX_MODEL` sets
  `--model`). Codex runs on its own WebSocket (`/ws/codex`) and its sessions appear in the
  sidebar next to Claude's. Because Codex only mints its rollout id **after** the first
  turn, the server watches `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` (home overridable via
  `CODEX_HOME`) and maps the new rollout to the session — attributed only when it's
  unambiguous, never by "newest wins". Resume reattaches a live PTY, adopts a surviving
  tmux session, or cold-resumes the rollout id.

**Choosing an agent.** The single view has a **New Codex session** button; each grid
cell's launch form and the Collections browser carry a **Claude / Codex** toggle (your
choice is remembered).

**Skills for Codex.** Codex has no `/<slug>` slash commands, so on session setup
MulmoTerminal **mirrors the workspace's `.claude/skills` into `~/.codex/skills`** (each
mirrored directory carries a `.mt-mirror` marker so a re-sync overwrites what MulmoTerminal
owns and never clobbers Codex's own skills), and rewrites a collection's `/<slug> …` seed
into a plain `Use the "<slug>" skill.` instruction. The same skills Claude uses then show
up for Codex, loaded by description.

---

## Session persistence (tmux)

If **`tmux` is installed**, MulmoTerminal runs each Claude session and launcher inside
a tmux session, so **a server crash or restart doesn't kill your terminals** — the
processes keep running and reattach when the server comes back (like `screen`/`tmux`).
A long build, a dev server, or a mid-turn Claude session all survive `node --watch`
reloads and crashes. It uses its **own** tmux server (`-L mulmoterminal`) and config, so
it never touches your personal tmux sessions or keybindings.

**No tmux? No problem** — terminals fall back to plain (non-persistent) PTYs, exactly as
before. An explicit close (a cell's ✕) ends the tmux session; a machine reboot does not
survive (tmux itself is gone). Command-cell scripts are ephemeral and not persisted.

**Installing tmux** (optional):

```bash
brew install tmux            # macOS (Homebrew)
sudo apt install tmux        # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dnf install tmux        # Fedora
```

On Windows there's no native tmux, so sessions use the non-persistent fallback — run the
server under **WSL** if you want persistence. Nothing else is required: MulmoTerminal
detects `tmux` on `PATH` at startup and uses it automatically when present.

---

## Docker sandbox (experimental, single view)

Set **`MULMOTERMINAL_SANDBOX=1`** (and have Docker running) to run the **single-view**
Claude session inside a container instead of on the host, while Claude still reaches the
app's GUI MCP + activity hooks over `host.docker.internal`. The `mulmoterminal-sandbox`
image is **built automatically** on first launch from the shipped `Dockerfile.sandbox`
(~1 min, once; rebuilt only when that file changes). Override the name with
`MULMOTERMINAL_SANDBOX_IMAGE`. If the image can't be built (e.g. Docker down), the session
falls back to the host spawn — no cryptic failure.

This **contains** Claude — it can't reach the host filesystem outside the mounts, host
processes, or arbitrary host ports. It is **not full isolation**: the **workspace** and
**`~/.claude`** are bind-mounted **read-write** by design (so Claude edits your project,
and transcripts interoperate with host sessions), so those specific paths stay mutable
from inside. The sandbox is **non-persistent** (the container is
`--rm`, tied to the session), **opt-in and single-view only** — the grid keeps its host +
tmux path, and with the flag unset (or Docker unavailable) everything runs on the host
exactly as before. **macOS only** for now — on Linux (bind-mount uid ownership) and
Windows (host paths aren't valid Linux container paths) it falls back to the host spawn;
both are follow-ups. Adding arbitrary user MCP servers to the sandbox is in progress
(see #202).

**Authentication (macOS).** Claude's live login token lives in the macOS **Keychain**,
which the container can't read (mounting `~/.claude` alone isn't enough — its
`.credentials.json` is often absent or stale). On each sandbox spawn MulmoTerminal exports
the current credential to a per-session `~/.mulmoterminal/sandbox/creds-<id>.json`
(mode `0600`, removed when the session ends) and mounts it **read-only** over the
container's `~/.claude/.credentials.json`; your host `~/.claude` is never modified. If
you've never logged in on the host, run `claude` once first — otherwise the server logs a
warning and the container shows "Not logged in".

**Host credentials (opt-in).** By default the sandbox has no host credentials. To let the
sandboxed Claude use `gh`/`git`, set **`SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS=gh,gitconfig`** — a **fixed
allowlist** (you pick names, never arbitrary paths): `gh` mounts `~/.config/gh` read-only
and passes a `GH_TOKEN` (from `gh auth token`, since macOS keeps it in the Keychain), and
`gitconfig` mounts `~/.gitconfig` read-only. Set **`SANDBOX_SSH_AGENT_FORWARD=1`** to
forward the SSH agent socket (the keys never enter the container). Both are read only when
building the sandbox spawn, so they have no effect unless `MULMOTERMINAL_SANDBOX` is on.

## Tech stack

| Layer    | Technology |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Frontend | Vue 3 (`<script setup>` + TypeScript), Vue Router, Vite, xterm.js (`@xterm/*`), CodeMirror 6, socket.io-client |
| Backend  | Node (ESM, TypeScript run via `tsx`), Express 5, `ws` (terminal WebSocket), `node-pty`, socket.io, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (in-process GUI MCP) |
| Plugins  | GUI-protocol Vue plugins (`@mulmoclaude/*`, `@mulmochat-plugin/*`): markdown, form, image, chart, HTML, collection, accounting |
| Tests    | Vitest + @vue/test-utils + jsdom |

Requires **Node ≥ 22.9** (uses `node --env-file-if-exists`) and the `claude` CLI on `PATH`.

---

## Configuration

The server is configured entirely through environment variables, optionally
loaded from a `.env` file via `node --env-file-if-exists=.env` (wired into the
npm scripts). The `.env` is optional — every variable below has a default, so
the server runs without one.

| Variable     | Default        | Description |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| `PORT`        | `34567`        | Backend HTTP/WebSocket port (prod: the URL you open). |
| `CLIENT_PORT` | `6856`         | Vite dev-server port (dev only: the URL you open with `yarn dev`). |
| `CLAUDE_BIN` | `claude`       | The Claude Code binary to spawn. |
| `CLAUDE_CWD` | current dir    | Working directory each `claude` PTY runs in; determines which project's sessions the sidebar lists. Via `npx mulmoterminal` it defaults to the directory you ran the command from (override with `--cwd <dir>`, relative allowed); when the server is run directly it falls back to `~/mulmoclaude`. A value read from `.env` must be an absolute path (`~` is not expanded). |
| `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` | `auto` | Permission mode passed to each `claude` spawn. |
| `MT_TITLE_MODEL` | `haiku` | Model used for the cell header's AI title (a cheap/fast model summarizing the recent turns). Accepts a `--model` alias or a full model id. |
| `CODEX_BIN`  | `codex`        | The Codex CLI binary to spawn. |
| `CODEX_MODEL`| codex default  | Model passed to Codex as `--model` (unset = Codex's own default). |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex`     | Codex home — where its session rollouts and MulmoTerminal-mirrored skills live. |
| `MULMOTERMINAL_HOME` | `~/.mulmoterminal` | Root for managed **git worktrees**. |
| `WAIT_REAP_GRACE_MS` | `1800000` | How long a **waiting** background session is kept before it's auto-reaped (`0` or negative = never). |

The Docker-sandbox variables (`MULMOTERMINAL_SANDBOX`, `MULMOTERMINAL_SANDBOX_IMAGE`,
`SANDBOX_MOUNT_CONFIGS`, `SANDBOX_SSH_AGENT_FORWARD`) and the update-check opt-outs
(`MULMOTERMINAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`, `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`) are covered in
[Docker sandbox](#docker-sandbox-experimental-single-view) and [Install & run](#install--run).

Example `.env` (gitignored):

```
CLAUDE_CWD=/Users/you/my-project
```

### UI settings (`~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`)

The Settings modal (⚙) persists per-user UI choices to `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`
(read/written via `GET`/`POST /api/config`):

| Field        | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `cwdPresets` | Quick-pick directories offered when launching a terminal. |
| `soundFile`  | Absolute path to a custom **attention sound** (played when a session needs attention). Empty/unset uses the built-in synthesized chime. |
| `prRepos`    | `owner/repo` entries whose open PRs/issues the cross-repo **PRs & Issues** view aggregates (via your `gh` login). |
| `launchers`  | `{ label, command }` entries offered in a grid cell's launcher besides Claude — a plain shell, `codex`, any interactive command. |
| `userMcpServers` | `{ id, url }` HTTP MCP servers merged into the **single-view** Claude session's `--mcp-config` (a `localhost` URL is reached over `host.docker.internal` in the Docker sandbox). Takes effect on the next session. |
| `buttons`    | Header action buttons — see [Header buttons](#header-buttons). Omit to keep the defaults; set to replace them. |
| `chips`      | Header info chips. Omit to keep the default set; `[]` hides all built-ins. |
| `pushEnabled` | `true` to send a **Web Push** to your registered devices when a background task finishes. Off by default; only sends while the **RemoteHost** channel is connected (see below). |
| `worklogEnabled` | `true` to run the built-in **dev worklog** batch (see below). Off by default (each run spawns an LLM session, so it costs tokens). |
| `worklogIntervalHours` | Worklog cadence in hours (default `6`, clamped to `1`–`168`). |

#### Header buttons

Each terminal header shows configurable **action buttons**. Omitting `buttons` (globally or per-dir)
keeps the built-in defaults — a **file-path picker** (📎) and an **OS file-manager reveal** (📂).
Setting `buttons` (at either level) **replaces** the defaults with your list, so you can drop, reorder,
or swap them — e.g. add the in-app **📁 file explorer** with `"open": { "files": "${dir}" }`.
A button has an `id`, `label`, and a `run` of `"shell"` (run a command), `"input"` (send text to the
agent), or `"open"`. An `open` button targets one of `url` / `reveal` (OS file manager) / `files`
(in-app explorer) / `view` (a built-in overlay) / `terminal` (a dir → a new cell running `$SHELL`,
opened next to the current one) / `pr: true` (open the current branch's PR — the button is hidden when
there's no open PR) / `pickFile: true` (OS file dialog → insert the path).
`${dir}`, `${branch}`, `${repo}`, … substitute live context, and `when` (e.g. `"isGitRepo"`) gates
visibility. The `/mulmoterminal-config` skill writes a valid config interactively; per-dir buttons
merge over the global ones by `id`.

**Attention sound.** The default chime is generated with the Web Audio API — **no
audio file is bundled**, so the npm package stays light and has no media-licensing
concerns. To use your own sound, set `soundFile` in Settings (Browse / Test / Use
chime) or in the config file; the server streams that file at `GET /api/sound` and
the client decodes it (falling back to the chime if it's missing or not audio). It's
your own local file referenced by absolute path — nothing is added to the package.

**Web Push on task finish.** Enable `pushEnabled` in Settings to have the server send a
push (title = the project dir, body = the last prompt) to your registered devices each
time a **background** task finishes — the same signal as the attention chime, but for the
panes you're not watching. Delivery is handled by the separate `mulmoserver` `sendPush`
Cloud Function; MulmoTerminal only makes the call, and only while the **RemoteHost**
channel is connected (its Google sign-in supplies the notification auth). With RemoteHost
disconnected, or with no device registered, the toggle is a no-op.

**Dev worklog (cross-clone).** Set `worklogEnabled: true` in
`~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` (and **restart** — the scheduler reads its tasks at boot)
to register a built-in scheduled task. Every `worklogIntervalHours` (default 6) it spawns
a Claude session that reviews the work you did across **all your saved working dirs**
(`cwdPresets`) since it last ran, and writes it up as a short manager-style report.
Multiple clones/worktrees of the same repo (e.g. `myapp`, `myapp2`) are **merged into one
per-repository section**, each covering what problem was addressed, what got solved, what's
still in progress, and — mined from the transcripts — decisions that were only *discussed
and not built*. The window is **since the last run** (tracked in
`config/scheduler/worklog-state.json`), not a fixed 6 h, so a missed/slept run doesn't drop
work. It reads and reconciles progress against `vision.md` / `milestones.md` (creating
empty ones if absent) so a long-running goal isn't forgotten.

Output lands in the wiki: one **weekly page** per ISO week
(`data/wiki/pages/dev-log-YYYY-www.md` — filenames are lowercase, or the wiki can't open
them), each tagged `worklog`. To browse them, open the **作業ログ 一覧** hub page
(`worklog`), which links every week, or click the **`#worklog`** tag in the wiki index.

Off by default because each run costs tokens — watch the cost readout and tune the cadence.
Run it on a single "hub" instance; running it in several instances sharing one workspace
double-fires it. The batch treats everything it reads (transcripts, git, wiki) as untrusted
data and only writes the worklog / hub / `vision` / `milestones` pages.

### Per-directory settings (`<project>/.mulmoterminal.json`)

Drop a `.mulmoterminal.json` in a project directory to give terminals opened **in
that directory** their own look and sound. It applies per terminal (per grid cell) —
the rest of the app keeps your chosen theme — and a directory's theme overrides your
manual theme pick for that terminal only. Every field is optional; a missing or
malformed file is ignored.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "PROD · payments",            // badge shown on this directory's terminals
  "badgeColor": "#cf222e",              // badge color (hex #rrggbb)
  "headerColor": "#190a23",             // cell header background (hex #rrggbb)
  "headerTextColor": "#ffffff",         // cell header text color (hex #rrggbb)
  "cellColor": "#101014",               // cell body background (hex #rrggbb)
  "cellBorderColor": "#2a2a4e",         // cell border color (hex #rrggbb)
  "dotColor": "#00e676",                // idle status dot (hex #rrggbb)
  "buttonColor": "#c7cdf0",             // header icon buttons (hex #rrggbb)
  "theme": "nord",                      // terminal palette: midnight | nord | daylight | solarized
  "colors": { "background": "#190a23", "cursor": "#ff2e63" }, // per-key palette overrides
  "sound": "./.mulmoterminal/alert.mp3" // attention sound, RELATIVE to this directory
}
```

| Field        | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| `name`       | Label shown as a badge in the terminal/cell header. |
| `badgeColor` | Badge background color (`#rrggbb`); text auto-contrasts. |
| `headerColor` | Header **background** color (`#rrggbb`) — the grid cell's header row and the terminal's own header row (grid row 2 + single view). While a terminal is working/blocked the status tint still shows; the custom color applies when idle. |
| `headerTextColor` | Header **text** color (`#rrggbb`) — the dir path, title, and prompt. |
| `cellColor` | Cell **body background** color (`#rrggbb`) — the frame around the terminal. |
| `cellBorderColor` | Cell **border** color (`#rrggbb`). The status frame (working/blocked) still overrides it while active. |
| `dotColor` | **Idle** status-dot color (`#rrggbb`). The working/waiting colors are unchanged so the activity signal stays intact. |
| `buttonColor` | Header **icon button** color (`#rrggbb`) — expand / close / attach / folder / etc., across both header rows. |
| `theme`      | xterm palette for terminals in this directory (one of the built-in theme ids). |
| `colors`     | Per-key xterm palette overrides applied on top of `theme` (or the app theme when `theme` is unset). Keys are xterm `ITheme` names (`background`, `foreground`, `cursor`, `selectionBackground`, the 16 ANSI colors, …); values are hex (`#rgb` / `#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa`). Unknown keys / bad values are dropped. |
| `sound`      | Attention sound for this directory's sessions, a path **relative to the directory** (served at `GET /api/dir-sound`). |

**Security.** `sound` is a directory-relative path only — absolute paths and any
`../` that escapes the directory are rejected, and the path is never taken from the
HTTP request, so an opened project can't point the player at arbitrary files.
Changes take effect when the terminal is next opened (no live file watch).

## Running

```bash
yarn install            # postinstall fixes node-pty prebuilt binary perms

yarn dev                # backend (:34567) + Vite UI (:6856), concurrently — open http://localhost:6856
# or individually:
yarn dev:server         # backend only  (node --import tsx --env-file-if-exists=.env server/index.ts)
yarn dev:client         # Vite dev server only

yarn build              # type-check (vue-tsc) + vite build -> dist/
yarn typecheck:server   # type-check the server (tsconfig.server.json)
yarn server             # run backend; serves dist/ + the APIs on :34567
yarn test               # vitest run
```

The backend is TypeScript run directly via `tsx` (no build step); `server/` is
type-checked separately through `tsconfig.server.json` (`strict`), kept out of
the main `build` so the two type-check independently.

In dev, open the Vite URL; its proxy forwards `/ws`, `/ws/pubsub`, and `/api` to
`:34567`. In production, run `yarn build` then `yarn server` and open
`http://localhost:34567`.

## Scripts (Run menu)

An empty grid cell's launcher sets the **Working directory** by typing, by a preset
chip, or with the **📁 folder button** (a native OS folder dialog). It also offers a
**run a script** row
that launches project scripts (a dev server, tests, a build, …) **in that cell, in
the directory the cell is pointed at** — so a whole workflow lives in one window
alongside the Claude sessions. Scripts are **per-directory**: the cell reads the
`script.json` of whatever directory you select, so different cells can offer
different projects' scripts.

The same launcher also has an **or launch** row for your configured **launch commands**
— a plain interactive shell, `codex`, any command — set in Settings (⚙) → **Launch
commands** as `{ label, command }` (e.g. `Shell` → `$SHELL`, `Codex` → `codex`). Unlike
a one-shot script, a launcher runs as a **persistent terminal in the cell's directory**:
it survives grid page switches and reconnects, and its dot shows running vs. exited (it
has no Claude hooks, so no blocked/done states).

Every running terminal's header also has a **▶ Run ▾** dropdown (next to the
connection status), in both the single view and each grid cell — but **only when the
open project has scripts** (no `script.json`, no button). It lists the **open
project's** `script.json` — the directory that terminal runs in — and launches the
picked script in a **spare grid cell** (reusing an open launcher, else a new one),
switching to the grid from the single view so you can watch it. So you can start a
dev server or tests for the project you're working in without disturbing the
session that's running.

The list is populated from a **`script.json`** at the chosen directory's root. It's
optional; a directory without one simply shows no scripts.

```jsonc
// <dir>/script.json
{
  "scripts": [
    { "label": "Dev server", "command": "yarn dev" },
    { "label": "Unit tests", "command": "yarn test" },
    { "label": "Build", "command": "yarn build" },
    // optional per-script working dir (relative to this file, or absolute):
    { "label": "Sub server", "command": "yarn serve", "cwd": "packages/server" }
  ]
}
```

| Field     | Required | Meaning |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| `label`   | yes      | What the launcher shows. |
| `command` | yes      | Shell command, run via the login shell (`$SHELL -lc "<command>"`). |
| `cwd`     | no       | Working dir, relative to `script.json` or absolute. Defaults to the cell's directory. |

A command terminal is **not** a Claude session: it has no session id, no hooks, no
transcript, and **isn't persisted** — it's ephemeral, so a page reload drops it and
closing the cell (or reloading) kills the process. When the command exits, the cell
offers a **↻ re-run**. The browser only ever sends the script's **index** + its
directory; the server reads that directory's `script.json` and resolves the
command, so the file is the allowlist of what can run.

Each command cell also has a **✦ Summarize** button: click it to send the cell's
captured output to `claude -p` (headless) and get a short **Errors / Warnings /
likely cause / suggested fix** note in a panel — handy when a build or install
buries the one failing line in thousands. It's manual (never auto-runs) and analyzes
the last 32 KB of output. See
[`POST /api/command/summarize`](#http-post-apicommandsummarize).

---

## Skills (Skill menu)

Next to the **▶ Run ▾** dropdown, every running terminal's header has a **⚡ Skill ▾**
dropdown — in both the single view and each grid cell, and **only when the open
project has skills** (nothing discovered, no button). It lists the
[Claude skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) discoverable for
that terminal's directory — both **project scope** (`<dir>/.claude/skills`) and **user
scope** (`~/.claude/skills`), the same skills Claude sees — and, on pick, **runs the
skill in that session**: it types the skill's invocation into the terminal and submits
it (for Claude, its `/<slug>` command; for Codex, which has no slash command, a plain
`Use the "<slug>" skill.` instruction). Unlike **▶ Run** — which launches a
`script.json` shell command in a spare cell — a skill runs **in the session you
picked it from**, continuing that conversation.

**Ordering:** working-dir (project) skills come **first**, then user-scope ones,
alphabetical within each group; a project skill of the same slug shadows the user one.

**Filtering:** add a `skills` array to the directory's
[`.mulmoterminal.json`](#per-directory-settings-projectmulmoterminaljson) to narrow the menu —
an allowlist of slugs that also sets the order (only those show, in that order). Omit
it to show everything.

```jsonc
// <dir>/.mulmoterminal.json
{ "skills": ["review-diff", "commit-msg"] }
```

Each menu item shows the skill's id, with its `SKILL.md` `description` as the hover
tooltip. A directory (or workspace) without any `.claude/skills` simply shows no
button. Skills are discovered read-only; the menu never creates or edits them.

---

## Files view (browse & edit)

A terminal header can carry a **📁 Files** button — add it as a [header button](#header-buttons)
(`"open": { "files": "${dir}" }`) — that opens a full-screen file explorer
rooted at **that terminal's project directory** — so after Claude says "wrote `foo.md`"
you can jump straight there to read or edit it. The left pane is a lazy-loaded directory
tree; clicking a file opens it in a **CodeMirror** editor (Markdown / JS-TS / JSON
highlighting, everything else as plain text). Markdown files get a **Preview** toggle
that renders via the server's sandboxed `…/md` HTML. **Save** (or ⌘/Ctrl-S) writes back.

All reads and writes go through `GET/PUT /api/files/browse/*?cwd=&path=`, and every
`path` is **contained within the project root** (server-side) — `..`/absolute escapes
are rejected for reads and writes alike, so editing can't reach outside the directory
the terminal is pointed at.

---

## Git worktrees & pull requests

When a terminal's directory is a git repo, its header shows a **branch chip**
(`⎇ <branch>` with dirty / ahead / behind counts), fed by `GET /api/git-status` (polled
while the view is visible). A **GitHub** menu links straight to the repo, its issues, and
its pull requests.

**Worktree isolation.** A grid cell's launch form offers **＋ New worktree**: name a task
and the cell launches its agent inside a fresh
[git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) on a new `agent/<slug>` branch — a
separate working tree that shares the repo's `.git`, so several agents can work the same
repo without colliding. Worktrees live under `~/.mulmoterminal/worktrees/` (override with
`MULMOTERMINAL_HOME`), and existing ones are listed for reuse.

A worktree cell's header carries a **diff badge** (`+<commits> ●<dirty>`); click it for a
**Changes vs `<base>`** panel (file list + patch) with actions:

- **✓ Commit** — hands the cell's own session a canned commit prompt.
- **⬆ Push** — `git push -u origin <branch>` (`POST /api/worktrees/push`).
- **⧉ Open PR** — pushes, then `gh pr create … --fill`; if `gh` is missing or unauthed it
  falls back to opening the GitHub **compare** URL (`POST /api/worktrees/pr`).

Closing a worktree cell asks whether to **keep** the worktree or **discard & remove** it
(a dirty worktree is never removed unless you confirm).

**PRs & Issues (cross-repo).** The toolbar's **Pull requests** button opens a full-screen
view that aggregates open PRs **and** issues across the repos listed in Settings →
**Pull request repos** (`prRepos`, `owner/repo` entries) via your server-side `gh` login.
PRs show a CI-rollup / review-decision / draft badge; each repo lists its latest open
issues. Rows are real links, per-repo errors don't sink the view, and the two lists load
independently. Backed by `GET /api/prs` and `GET /api/issues`.

---

## Cost & token usage

Each grid cell's header shows two badges for its session, refreshed when a turn finishes
(from `GET /api/session/:id`):

- **Context badge** — e.g. `Opus · ctx 35%`: the model family plus how full its context
  window is (the *last* turn's input + cache tokens ÷ the model's window — **1M** for
  current-gen Opus / Sonnet / Fable, **200k** otherwise; an unknown model shows the label
  with no %).
- **Token badge** — `⇡<in> ⇣<out>`: cumulative input (fresh + cache-read + cache-creation)
  and output tokens for the session, k/M-formatted, with a full breakdown in the tooltip.

The **Settings** modal (⚙) shows an **estimated $ cost** — Session / Today / Month — from
`GET /api/cost`, using a built-in public per-model price table (cache reads billed at
0.1×, cache writes at 1.25× input). It's an estimate: real billing differs, **flat-plan
(Max) usage isn't reflected**, and turns on unpriced models are flagged and excluded.

A separate, full **double-entry accounting** book (the `account_balance` toolbar button →
`/accounting`) is provided by the bundled `@mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin` and stores its
books under `<workspace>/data/accounting`. It's a bookkeeping app — unrelated to the LLM
cost estimate above — and is also exposed to Claude as the `manageAccounting` GUI tool.

---

## Wiki, Collections & the GUI panel

MulmoTerminal is also a **live view over the shared workspace** (`CLAUDE_CWD`, default
`~/mulmoclaude`) that agents author into — never a snapshot, so it re-reads on entry.

**GUI panel.** Beside the terminal, a **GUI panel** ("Canvas") renders the rich results of
GUI-protocol tools the agent calls — documents (`presentDocument`), forms (`presentForm`),
generated images, charts, HTML, and collection cards. Each result is drawn by its plugin's
own Vue view inside a Shadow-DOM `PluginFrame` (so a plugin's bundled CSS can't leak),
mirrors the active session, and replays history on re-select. Plugins reach the agent over
an **in-process MCP server** served per session at `POST /api/mcp/:sessionId` (server name
`mulmoterminal-gui`) — which works from the host *or* the Docker sandbox (over
`host.docker.internal`). Which plugins load is gated by `plugins/plugins.json`; the shipped
set includes markdown, form, image generation (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`), chart, HTML, and
collection views. You can also merge your **own HTTP MCP servers** into the single-view
session via Settings → `userMcpServers`.

**Wiki.** The toolbar **Wiki** button opens a read-only browser over `<workspace>/data/wiki/`
— an **index** (tag-filterable page catalog), rendered **pages** with `[[wiki links]]` and
backlinks, a **graph** view (pages ranked by references), and a **lint** report (orphans /
broken links / tag drift). Read-only endpoints: `GET /api/wiki`, `/api/wiki/graph`,
`/api/wiki/lint`.

**Collections.** The toolbar **Collections** button browses the workspace's collection
"cards" (`@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin`). Running a collection **action** fetches a seed
prompt and spawns a fresh agent session for it — the **Launch with Claude / Codex** toggle
decides which agent (and whether the seed auto-runs or drops in as an editable draft).
Favorited collections get their own toolbar buttons.

---

## More features

- **Grid of parallel sessions** — the ＋ Terminal / grid view runs many sessions at once,
  auto-sizing by count across pages. Cell borders signal state at a glance — **working**
  (pulsing blue), **blocked** (amber — needs a permission / answer), **done** (blue —
  finished, output unreviewed), and **idle** — and the toolbar shows a tally across all
  pages so you notice an off-screen cell that needs you.
- **Timeline** (🕘) — a read-only per-session activity timeline (tools run, newest first),
  from `GET /api/transcript/timeline`.
- **Tools pane** — the available GUI tools plus a live tool-call history for the active
  session.
- **Notifications** (🔔) — a toolbar bell with an unread badge and a dropdown of active
  notifications; click a row to jump to its session.
- **Voice input** — dictate a prompt via on-device Whisper (`POST /api/transcribe`, macOS
  only; the model downloads on first use).
- **Remote host** — link MulmoTerminal to the companion phone client (Google sign-in) to
  watch and start sessions from your phone.
- **Themes** — four terminal palettes (midnight / nord / daylight / solarized), your pick
  remembered; a project's `.mulmoterminal.json` can override per directory.
- **Editing niceties** — **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline in the prompt, and on macOS
  **Option** is treated as Meta so Claude's Alt-key bindings work.

## Server API specification

Base URL: `http://localhost:$PORT` (default `http://localhost:34567`).

### HTTP: `GET /api/sessions`

Lists the most-recent chat sessions for the current project (`CLAUDE_CWD`),
newest first, including freshly-created sessions that aren't yet written to disk.

**Response `200 application/json`**

```jsonc
{
  "cwd": "/Users/you/my-project",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "d16f43f3-ef63-4a5e-b273-debaccb3522a", // session UUID (= .jsonl basename)
      "title": "Review available skills list",        // see "Session discovery & titles"
      "mtime": 1781471064511.22,                       // last-modified, ms epoch (sort key)
      "working": false,                                // Claude is mid-turn (blue dot)
      "waiting": false                                 // needs attention (bold)
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

- Sessions are read from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded CLAUDE_CWD>/*.jsonl` and
  merged with in-memory sessions started this run but not yet persisted (those
  have `title: "New session"` and `mtime` = creation time).
- Sorted by `mtime` descending and capped at the **50** most recent. Files are
  ranked by a cheap `stat`-only pass; only the top 50 are read and parsed for
  titles, so the endpoint stays cheap regardless of how many sessions exist.
- `500 { "error": string }` on an unexpected filesystem error. A missing project
  directory is **not** an error — it yields an empty `sessions` array.

### HTTP: `GET /api/scripts`

The runnable entries from `<cwd>/script.json` for a cell's chosen directory
(`?cwd=<dir>`, falling back to `CLAUDE_CWD`); see
[Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu). The resolved `cwd` is echoed back (the
server may fall back from a bad path), and each entry carries its `index` (the
position the client sends back to `/ws/run`).

```jsonc
// GET /api/scripts?cwd=/Users/me/proj
{
  "cwd": "/Users/me/proj",
  "scripts": [
    { "index": 0, "label": "Dev server", "command": "yarn dev" },
    { "index": 1, "label": "Sub server", "command": "yarn serve", "cwd": "packages/server" }
  ]
}
```

A missing or invalid `script.json` is **not** an error — it yields an empty
`scripts` array.

### HTTP: `GET /api/skills`

The Claude skills discoverable for a terminal's chosen directory (`?cwd=<dir>`,
falling back to `CLAUDE_CWD`) — project scope (`<cwd>/.claude/skills`) plus user scope
(`~/.claude/skills`), deduped by slug (project shadows user), **working-dir skills
first**; see [Skills (Skill menu)](#skills-skill-menu). A `skills` allowlist in that
directory's `.mulmoterminal.json` narrows and reorders the result; absent → all. The
resolved `cwd` is echoed back. Each entry carries its `slug` (the skill invoked as
`/<slug>`) and the `SKILL.md` `description` (the menu tooltip).

```jsonc
// GET /api/skills?cwd=/Users/me/proj
{
  "cwd": "/Users/me/proj",
  "skills": [
    { "slug": "commit", "description": "Write a commit message" },
    { "slug": "review", "description": "Review the current diff" }
  ]
}
```

A directory without any discoverable skills is **not** an error — it yields an empty
`skills` array.

### HTTP: `POST /api/command/summarize`

Runs `claude -p` **headless** over a command cell's captured terminal output and
returns a short summary (Errors / Warnings / likely cause / suggested fix). Backs the
**✦ Summarize** button on a Run cell (see [Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu)).
The browser sends the cell's xterm buffer as `log`; the server truncates it to the
last **32 KB** (the tail, where errors + the exit line live), runs the CLI with the
log piped on stdin (argv — no shell), and returns its answer. Same-origin guarded.

**Request `application/json`**:

```jsonc
{ "log": "npm ERR! cannot find module 'foo'\n..." }
```

**Response `200 application/json`**:

```jsonc
{
  "summary": "Errors: cannot find module 'foo'\nSuggested fix: run `yarn add foo`",
  "truncated": false // true when the log exceeded 32 KB and only the tail was analyzed
}
```

Empty output returns a `{ summary }` note rather than calling the CLI. Errors:
`400` (missing `log`), `403` (disallowed origin), `502` (the `claude` run failed).

### HTTP: `POST /api/hook`

**Internal endpoint.** Claude hooks (injected per session — see
[Claude hook injection](#claude-hook-injection)) POST their event payload here.
You normally don't call this yourself.

**Request `application/json`** — the Claude hook payload; only these fields are used:

```jsonc
{
  "session_id": "d16f43f3-...",        // the session the event is for
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit" // "UserPromptSubmit" | "Stop" | "Notification"
}
```

Effect (see [Session model](#session-model)):

| `hook_event_name`  | Effect |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `working = true` for the session. |
| `Stop`             | `working = false`; if the session is **backgrounded**, also `waiting = true`. |
| `Notification`     | If the session is **backgrounded**, `waiting = true`. |

Any resulting state change is published on the `sessions` pub/sub channel.

**Response `200 application/json`**: `{ "ok": true }` (always, even for unknown events).

### More HTTP endpoints

### WebSocket: `/ws` (terminal)

A raw WebSocket carrying the terminal stream for one session. One PTY per
connection (or reattach to an existing background PTY).

**Connect**

- `ws://host/ws` — start a **new** session (server generates a UUID and spawns
  `claude --session-id <uuid> --settings <hooks>`).
- `ws://host/ws?session=<id>` — **resume/reattach** a session. If a live
  background PTY exists for `<id>`, the socket reattaches to it (and its recent
  output buffer is replayed); otherwise the server spawns
  `claude --resume <id> --settings <hooks>`.

**Server → client** (JSON text frames):

| Message | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `{ "type": "session", "id": string }` | Sent immediately on connect — the session id this socket is bound to (lets the client learn a new session's generated id). |
| `{ "type": "output", "data": string }` | PTY output to write to the terminal. On reattach, the first `output` frame is the replayed tail buffer (≤ 64 KB). |
| `{ "type": "exit", "exitCode": number, "signal": number }` | The `claude` process exited; the socket then closes. |

**Client → server** (JSON text frames):

| Message | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `{ "type": "input", "data": string }` | Keystrokes / bytes to write to the PTY. |
| `{ "type": "resize", "cols": number, "rows": number }` | Resize the PTY. |

A non-JSON frame is written to the PTY verbatim (fallback).

**Disconnect** — when the socket closes, if Claude is still `working` the PTY is
**kept alive** in the background; otherwise it's killed. See
[Session lifecycle](#session-lifecycle).

### More WebSocket endpoints

Two more raw WebSockets share the `/ws` frame format (`output` / `input` / `resize` /
`exit`):

- **`/ws/codex?session=<id>&cwd=<dir>&gui=<0|1>`** — a **Codex** agent PTY (see
  [Agents: Claude & Codex](#agents-claude--codex)). Like `/ws` it sends a `session` frame
  with the id and reattaches to a live or tmux-backed session on resume. `gui=0` (grid
  cells) omits the GUI MCP and keeps the session out of the sidebar.
- **`/ws/launch?session=<id>&cwd=<dir>&launcher=<index>`** — a **launch command** PTY (a
  plain shell, `codex`, or any command configured in Settings → Launch commands). Unlike a
  Run-menu script it's **persistent and reattachable** (survives page switches /
  reconnects), but it has no Claude hooks, so its dot only shows running vs. exited.

### WebSocket: `/ws/run` (command terminal)

A raw WebSocket carrying a one-off **Run-menu command** (see
[Scripts (Run menu)](#scripts-run-menu)) — a plain shell PTY, **not** a Claude
session, so there's no `session` message, no hooks, and no reattach.

**Connect**

- `ws://host/ws/run?index=<n>&cwd=<dir>` — run the script at position `<n>` in
  `<dir>/script.json` (cwd falls back to `CLAUDE_CWD`). The server reads that
  file and spawns `$SHELL -lc "<command>"` in the script's `cwd`. An out-of-range
  index (or a missing/invalid `script.json`) yields
  `{ "type": "error", "message": string }` and the socket closes.

The **output / input / resize / exit** frames are identical to `/ws`. There is no
`session` frame.

**Disconnect** — the terminal is **ephemeral**: when the socket closes (cell
closed, or page reloaded) the process is **killed**. There is no background
survival and no resume.

### Socket.IO: `/ws/pubsub` (activity pub/sub)

A minimal Socket.IO pub/sub for live session-activity updates. Channel names are
Socket.IO rooms.

- **Path**: `/ws/pubsub`, transport: `websocket`.
- **Client → server events**:
  - `subscribe` with a channel name (string) → join the room.
  - `unsubscribe` with a channel name (string) → leave the room.
- **Server → client event**: `data` with `{ channel: string, data: <payload> }`.

**Channel `"sessions"`** — payloads describe a single session change:

```jsonc
// activity change (working/waiting flipped)
{ "id": "d16f43f3-...", "working": false, "waiting": true, "event": "Stop" }

// a brand-new session was created
{ "id": "…", "working": false, "event": "created" }

// a session's PTY was closed/reaped
{ "id": "…", "working": false, "event": "closed" }
```

`event` is the originating hook (`UserPromptSubmit` | `Stop` | `Notification`) or
a lifecycle marker (`created` | `closed` | `null`). The client treats **any**
`sessions` message as a signal to refetch `GET /api/sessions` (the server is the
single source of truth for the list), so payload details are advisory.

---

## Session model

Per-session state lives on the server (`activity` map) and is surfaced as two
booleans on every session record:

| Flag      | Set when | Cleared when | UI |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | -- |
| `working` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires (Claude started a turn) | `Stop` hook fires (turn finished) | **Blue dot** next to the title |
| `waiting` | A **background** session fires `Notification` (waiting for input — permission / question / idle) **or** `Stop` (finished, output unseen, ready for another message) | The session is brought to the **foreground** (a WebSocket attaches to it) | **Bold** title |

"Foreground" = a session that currently has an attached terminal WebSocket (the
one you're viewing). `waiting` is only ever set for **background** sessions,
because a foreground session is already on screen.

## Session lifecycle

```
        new ws /ws                         ws /ws?session=<id>
            │                                      │
            ▼                                      ▼
   generate UUID, spawn               live bg PTY?  ──yes──►  reattach + replay buffer
   claude --session-id <uuid>              │ no
   register "New session",                 ▼
   publish "created"               spawn claude --resume <id>
            │                                      │
            └───────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                            ▼
                   attached (foreground)  ── setWaiting(false) ──► not bold
                            │
              ws close (switch away / disconnect)
                            │
            ┌───────── working? ──────────┐
           yes                            no
            │                             │
   keep PTY alive (background)        kill PTY (reap), publish "closed"
            │
   Stop hook in background:
   waiting=true (bold), working=false, reap PTY
   (flag persists via on-disk record → stays listed & bold until viewed)
```

Key rules:

- **Switching away never interrupts Claude mid-turn** — a `working` session's PTY
  survives in the background.
- A background session that goes **idle** (`Stop`) is **reaped** (killed). If it
  finished with unseen output, its `waiting` flag persists via the on-disk
  session record, so it stays listed and **bold** until you open it.
- **Reattach over respawn**: selecting a session that still has a live background
  PTY reattaches to it (replaying a ≤ 64 KB output tail) instead of spawning a
  duplicate `claude`.
- **One live viewer per session**: a session is bound to a single socket. Opening
  it in a second place (another tab, or another grid cell pointed at the same dir)
  reattaches there and **supersedes** the first, which detaches. To avoid doing
  this by accident, a grid launcher's resume list **flags rows already open in
  another terminal** (`● open`) and **asks for confirmation** before taking one
  over.
- Brand-new sessions appear in the sidebar **immediately** (before their `.jsonl`
  exists) via the in-memory `knownSessions` registry + a `created` push; an
  unused one disappears when its PTY is reaped.

---

## Claude hook injection

Activity is detected via Claude Code hooks injected **per spawn**, without
touching the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` or project settings. The server
passes `claude --settings '<json>'` where the JSON registers a command hook for
`UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `Notification`, each of which pipes the hook
payload to the server:

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl -s -X POST http://localhost:$PORT/api/hook -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @-" }] }],
    "Stop":             [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl … -d @-" }] }],
    "Notification":     [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl … -d @-" }] }]
  }
}
```

Because the server spawns each new session with `--session-id <uuid>`, it always
knows the live session's id — even before the session's `.jsonl` file exists.

---

## Session discovery & titles

Claude stores each project's sessions as JSONL files under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, where the absolute `cwd`
has its `/` and `.` characters replaced with `-` (e.g.
`/Users/you/proj` → `-Users-you-proj`).

A session's display **title** is derived by scanning its JSONL for, in order of
preference:

1. a live **AI title** the server generated for the session this run (see below),
2. else the latest `ai-title` record's `aiTitle` (e.g. written by MulmoClaude),
3. else the latest `last-prompt` record's `lastPrompt`,
4. else the first real user message (slash/local-command wrappers like
   `<local-command-…>` are skipped),
5. else `"(untitled session)"`.

In-memory sessions not yet persisted show as `"New session"` until their file
appears, at which point the on-disk title takes over.

### AI header title

The raw last prompt is a poor cell-header label once a session becomes a
back-and-forth: a follow-up is either a trivial ack (`ok`, `はい` — skipped, so the
header keeps showing the now-stale opening task) or context-dependent (`2番目にして`
— meaningless on its own). So the server summarizes the **recent turns** with a cheap
model (`MT_TITLE_MODEL`, default `haiku`) into a short title and shows it in the cell
header (falling back to the last prompt when there's no title yet).

Generation is kept low-cost — it runs at a turn's `Stop` (when the reply is on disk)
only when a title is **due**: none yet, the newest prompt was a trivial/context-dependent
ack (so the raw last prompt would be stale), or every few turns to keep a long session's
title current. The title lives in memory (never written into Claude's own transcript); a
resumed session falls back to any on-disk `ai-title`.

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

`src/components/Sidebar.spec.ts` covers the sidebar: rendering the server's
session list, the working dot, the `waiting` bold state, refetching on a pub/sub
push, and emitting `select` on click. The pub/sub composable and `fetch` are
mocked so the tests run without a server.
