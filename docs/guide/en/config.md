## Global config `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json`

```json
{
  "cwdPresets": [
    { "label": "acme-web", "path": "/Users/you/projects/acme-web" },
    { "label": "acme-api", "path": "/Users/you/projects/acme-api" }

  "buttons": [],
  "chips": null
}
```

| `launchers` | The launch commands that appear under "OR LAUNCH" in a grid cell |
| `prRepos` | The repos targeted by the cross-repo PR/Issue view |
| `buttons` / `chips` | Header buttons / chips (merged with project settings → [Customizing the header](#header)) |
| `providers` | Anthropic-compatible backends (→ [Using another model via OpenRouter](providers.html)) |
| `soundFile` | Custom notification sound (absolute path to an audio file; also settable from the modal) |
| `pushEnabled` | Where the Web Push toggle is stored (default `false` → [Mobile notifications](notifications.html)) |
| `worklogEnabled` / `worklogIntervalHours` | The periodic dev-work log (default off / 6 hours) |
| `terminalSubmit` | Which bytes mean **submit** vs **newline** — `"cr"` (default) or `"esc-cr"` (→ [Enter — submit vs. newline](#terminal-submit)) |

## Running on another model (providers) {#providers}

Claude Code can talk to any Anthropic-compatible backend. The backend goes in `providers` in
`config.json`, the **key in the server's environment** (never in a config file), and the default model
in a project's `.mulmoterminal.json` — with a per-session override at launch.

```json
{
  "providers": [
    { "id": "openrouter", "label": "OpenRouter", "baseUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api", "tokenEnv": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "maxOutputTokens": 16000 }
  ]
}
```

Note that `baseUrl` must not end in `/v1`, and `tokenEnv` is the **name** of a variable, not the key.

[Using another model via OpenRouter](providers.html).**

## Enter — submit vs. newline (`terminalSubmit`) {#terminal-submit}

Whether **Enter submits** your prompt or **inserts a newline** is decided by Claude Code (its
TUI), from the *bytes* the terminal sends it — not by MulmoTerminal. Two byte sequences are in
play:

- **CR** (`\r`) — what a bare **Enter** sends.
- **ESC + CR** (`\x1b\r`) — what **Option/Alt+Enter**, and MulmoTerminal's **Shift+Enter**, send.

Claude Code's **standard** binding reads **CR = submit** and **ESC+CR = newline**. That is
MulmoTerminal's default, so **you don't need this setting unless you have changed it**. Some people
rebind Claude Code the other way round (**CR = newline, ESC+CR = submit**); for them Shift+Enter
would *submit* the prompt, and the phone's "send" would only *type* the text without submitting it.
`terminalSubmit` makes both the keyboard and the phone follow your binding.

```jsonc
{ "terminalSubmit": "cr" }      // default: Enter submits, Shift+Enter makes a newline
{ "terminalSubmit": "esc-cr" }  // reversed: Enter submits with ESC+CR, Shift+Enter makes a newline
```

| Mode | Enter | Shift+Enter · Option/Alt+Enter | Phone "send" (remote view) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cr` (default) | submit (`\r`) | newline (`\x1b\r`) | submits with `\r` |
| `esc-cr` | submit (`\x1b\r`) | newline (`\r`) | submits with `\x1b\r` |

In **both** modes the *meaning* is the same — **Enter submits, Shift/Option+Enter make a newline** —
only the bytes differ, so they match your Claude binding.

### Which one do I need?

Almost everyone wants the default (`cr`) — leave it unset. Choose `esc-cr` **only if, in
MulmoTerminal, Shift+Enter *submits* your prompt instead of adding a line** (equivalently: a bare
Enter drops to a new line instead of submitting). That is the tell-tale sign your Claude Code is on
the reversed binding. If you're unsure, keep `cr`; switch to `esc-cr` only if Shift+Enter misbehaves.

### How to set it

1. Open `~/.mulmoterminal/config.json` (create the file if it doesn't exist) and add the key at the
   top level — for the reversed binding:
   ```json
   { "terminalSubmit": "esc-cr" }
   ```
2. **Reload the browser tab** — the keyboard reads the value when the page loads.
3. **Restart `mulmoterminal`** — the phone remote-view "send" reads the value from the file at
   startup, so a hand-edit needs a restart to take effect there.
4. Verify: a bare **Enter** submits, and **Shift+Enter** drops to a new line.

An invalid value (a typo, or anything other than `"cr"` / `"esc-cr"`) is ignored and falls back to
`"cr"`, so a mistake never leaves Enter in a broken state.

### Notes

- **Smartphones** — a soft keyboard can only send a bare **Enter** (there is no Shift+Enter, and on
  Android the Return key often isn't even a normal Enter). So on a phone Enter follows the table
  above and you can't insert a newline from the on-screen keyboard; compose multi-line prompts from
  the remote view's text box instead.
- **Japanese / other IME input** — while the IME is composing, **Enter confirms the candidate** and
  is never taken as submit or newline, in either mode. Your CJK input is unaffected.

## Per-project `.mulmoterminal.json` {#per-dir}

Place this at the project root to change the appearance, sound, and header of **terminals (grid cells) opened in that directory**.

### Which model to use

```json
{
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code"
}
```

The backend and model this directory's sessions start on. Omit `provider` and give only `model` to
pick a different model on Anthropic itself. → [Using another model via OpenRouter](providers.html)

### Name badge and colors

```json
{
  "name": "acme-web",
  "badgeColor": "#2563eb",
  "headerColor": "#0b2545",
  "headerTextColor": "#e6f0ff",
  "cellColor": "#0e1117",
  "cellBorderColor": "#1f6f4f",
  "dotColor": "#22c55e",
  "buttonColor": "#a7f3d0"
}
```

All values are `#rrggbb`. The working / needs-you status colors take priority over these background colors (which show when idle).

### The terminal itself (xterm palette)

Where `headerColor` and friends tint the **chrome** (header / cell frame), **`colors` (and `theme`) tint the terminal
itself (xterm)**. `colors` overrides xterm's ITheme — `background` / `foreground` / `cursor` and the 16 ANSI colors
(`red`, `green`, …).

```json
{
  "name": "🌌 van-gogh",
  "headerColor": "#0b1a4a",
  "headerTextColor": "#f2e29b",
  "colors": { "background": "#0a1330", "foreground": "#f2e29b", "cursor": "#f5b301" }
}
```

Set `theme` to `midnight` / `nord` / `daylight` / `solarized` for a preset palette; `colors` layers per-key
overrides on top. The color-coding screenshot in [Scenario 6](scenarios.html) combines header colors with `colors` to
paint each project — **from the header down to the terminal body**.

### Customizing the header (buttons / chips) {#header}

This is where MulmoTerminal's **Extend** pillar lives. Shape the header of a running terminal to fit your workflow with **a small DSL**.
Any developer can turn their frequent actions into a single click and surface only the information they want to see — that's what this is for.

**Buttons** (`buttons`) — action buttons that act on a running session. Display is an `emoji` or an `icon` (a Material Symbol name) plus a `label`; `order` controls the sort.
With none set, you get a **built-in starter set**: 📎 insert a file path · 📂 reveal in the file manager · 📁 browse files in the app · 🖥 new terminal here · 🔗 this branch's PR (git repos, only when a PR exists) · 🌐 open on GitHub (git repos). Setting `buttons` at any level **replaces the whole default set** (it is _not_ merged on top) — so listing your own, even a **shorter** list, is how you trim, reorder, or swap them.

```json
{
  "buttons": [
    { "id": "compact", "emoji": "🗜️", "label": "Compact", "run": "input", "text": "/compact", "when": "agent == claude" },
    { "id": "gh",      "emoji": "🌐", "label": "Open on GitHub", "run": "open", "open": { "url": "https://github.com/${repo}" }, "when": "isGitRepo" },
    { "id": "reveal",  "emoji": "📁", "label": "Reveal folder", "run": "open", "open": { "reveal": "${dir}" } },
    { "id": "build",   "emoji": "🔨", "label": "Build", "run": "shell", "cmd": "yarn build" }
  ]
}
```

- `run: "input"` … send `text` to the running Claude/Codex (e.g. `/compact`).
- `run: "open"` … `url` (browser, http/https only) / `reveal` (OS file manager: Finder/Explorer/xdg-open) / `files` (in-app explorer) / `pickFile` (OS file dialog, inserts the path) / `terminal` (a new terminal cell in that directory) / `pr` (the current branch's PR in the browser) / `view` (`diff`/`prs`/`wiki`/`collections`/`accounting`).
- `run: "shell"` … run `cmd` in a command cell (the id is resolved server-side, `${variables}` are shell-escaped, and the command never reaches the browser).
- `${variables}` … `dir` `dirName` `branch` `repo` `remoteUrl` `ahead` `behind` `dirty` `agent` `model` `task` `session`.
- `when` … `isGitRepo` / `agent == …` / `repo == …` (`&&` / `||`, with `&&` taking precedence).

**Chips** (`chips`) — reorder / hide the info chips in a grid cell header, plus custom ones. `null` (the default) behaves as before.

```json
{ "chips": ["ctx", "git", { "label": "env", "text": "⎇ ${branch}", "when": "isGitRepo" }] }
```

- Built-in `dir` / `git` / `diff` / `ctx` / `usage` / `status` / `tools` … shown in the order you list them; omit one to hide it.
- Custom `{ label, text, when }` … read-only text (`text` expands `${variables}`).

### ⚡ Skill menu filter (`skills`)

The header's **⚡ Skill ▾** lists the skills available in that directory
(`<project>/.claude/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`). Working-dir (project) skills come
first, then user-scope ones. Picking one runs the skill **in the current session**
(Claude: `/<slug>`; Codex: `Use the "<slug>" skill.`).

Set `skills` to an allowlist to show **only those slugs, in that order**. **Omit it to
show everything.**

```json
{ "skills": ["review-diff", "commit-msg"] }
```

- Skill names (slugs) must start alphanumeric and contain only `a-z 0-9 - _`; a slug that doesn't resolve is ignored.

## Scripts `<project>/script.json`

Your project's scripts that can run in a grid cell (dev server, tests, build, and so on).

```json
{ "scripts": [ { "label": "dev", "command": "yarn dev" }, { "label": "test", "command": "yarn test", "cwd": "." } ] }
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CWD` / `--cwd` | The directory you run `npx mulmoterminal` in (only `~/mulmoclaude` when the server is started directly) | The default working directory (the PTY's cwd); also set via `--cwd` |
| `PORT` | `34567` | The server port |
| `MULMOTERMINAL_HOME` | `~/.mulmoterminal` | The root for managed git worktrees |
